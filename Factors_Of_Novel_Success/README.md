## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the success of novels. We will explore a dataset containing information about authors, books, and various features associated with them. The dataset includes variables such as book ratings, author details, genres, and more.

## Preparation

In this section, we will prepare the dataset by cleaning and adding some additional features.

## Data Visualization

In this section, we will visualize the data to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.

## Modeling

In this section, we will build predictive models to understand the impact of various features on book ratings.

## Code Appendix

This section contains the code used for data preparation, data visualization, and modeling.
